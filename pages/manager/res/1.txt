Any new SIM should be automatically detected, you dont even need to refresh the page.
No SIM found ? Make sure that:
-This device and the Semasim gateway ( the Raspberry Pi ) are connected to the same local network. ( required only for pairing the SIM with the account ).
-The SIM you are trying to register have not already been registered with an other account.
-Your Semasim gateway is able to power all the GSM dongles connected to it.
-The problem does not come from the USB hub you might be using.
